            <p>HTML is known as HyperText Markup Language and is the basic building blocks of web pages in web development.
                It provides the basic structure of a web page from the headings to the paragraphs and even such things as images
                and links: html has it all. By itself, html is a very powerful tool and is the foundational building blocks of 
                everything you see on a website, whether using mobile or pc, html is vital to the functioning of a website.
            </p>
            <p>As important as HTML is to the building of a website however, it's usefulness would be fairly bland without its
                cousin and close brother: CSS. But on its own, you can do many things with html such as building quizzes and sign
                in forms, building informative webpages, navigation bars, tables, and forms to submit and so many more things 
                that so many take for granted online every day. Everything you see online, if it has anything to do with Web 
                development, will have HTML as its foundation. It is vital to the function of a web page so that it cannot exist
                without this foundation.

                and the content. It makes it easier to do margins and things-->

            <article>
            <p>CSS aka Cascading Style Sheets, is where websites really begin to shine. It's been said that if HTML
                is the "skeleton" of a website, then CSS is the muscles and the skin: it really is that vital to the 
                aesthetics of a web page. CSS provides structure and elegance to your HTML and works hand in hand with 
                it: changing the font style and the size, where elements appear on a page, how large the heading and how
                things are styled, sizing images and other elements, providing color to anything from fonts to backgrounds to
                borders and anything in between, and really anything you could ever need to do to brighten up the appearence 
                of a web page, CSS is where it's at.
            </p>
            <p>When styling your HTML, it's important to keep track of your classes and ids of your elements and there are so 
                many ways to choose those elements. In CSS these are called "selectors". In this way you can really pin-point 
                the elements exactly with CSS and customize your web page however you want and in any style. By utilizing selectors,
                a web developer can add a unique touch to every website, adapting to the ever changing needs of the customer to
                provide the very best experience possible.

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_a_Div?">
            <header>What is a Div?</header>
            <article>
            <p>So what is this thing called a div and why is it important in building a web page? A div is a "container"
                in which things like paragraphs and sentences are placed. It provides a sort of "box" into which all manner
                of elements are placed in HTML, and then later styled in CSS. In this way a web developer can design sections
                of their web pages to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. 
            </p>
            <figure class="div">
              <figcaption>This is a Div:</figcaption>
                 <pre><code>
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                </code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>Oftentimes Divs will be assigned "classes" for the purposes of styling. It singles out that 
                "box" and says "You there! Yes you, I want you over here" and so on. Making it relatively easy to
                style a webpage. An example of giving a div a class is below:</p>
            
            <figure class="div">
              <figcaption>Div with a Class:</figcaption>
                 <pre><code>
                &lt;div class="container1"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                </code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>The CSS would look something like this if you wanted to target that particular "container1"
                created above
            </p>

            <figure class="div">
              <figcaption>CSS to target this class:</figcaption>
                 <pre><code>
                    .container1{
                        width: 100%;
                        margin: auto;
                    }
                </code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>This would make the div container1 take up 100% of the available space, and make the 
                margins automatic, meaning if all else is equal it would be centered on the page.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_a_table_and_its_basic_elements?">
            <header>What is a table and its basic elements?</header>
            <article>
            <p>Ever wanted to make a table like the ones you see in Excel but don't want to have to learn it?
                With HTML and CSS to style it, you can create your very own tables with your own colors, fonts, styles,
                and basically anything else that you could need tailor-made to your own needs. With the right understanding
                of HTML and CSS, you could very well create your own style and fashion of table to lay out information in 
                a stylish yet functional way.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <figcaption>Basic Elements for Tables</figcaption>
                <ul>
                    <li>Table</li>
                    <li>thead</li>
                    <li>tbody</li>
                    <li>tr</li>
                    <li>th</li>
                    <li>td</li>
                </ul>
            </figure>
            <p>First you have to use the table element to show the browser that you're creating a table. Inside of this,
                you'll have the thead (or table header) and your tbody (or table body). These are the basic building blocks
                of a table. The thead acts as the header for the columns of a table, providing a structure, while the tbody 
                is where your tr (or table rows) will store your th (description of that row) and your td (table data cell). tbody 
                is mostly your horizontal cells of your table with the thead holding the "headers" of those cells.
            </p>
            <p>The basic syntax looks something like this:</p>
           
            <figure class="table-code">
                <figcaption>Code</figcaption>
            <pre><code>
                &lt;table&gt;
                    &lt;thead&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                    &lt;thead&gt;
                    &lt;tbody&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                    &lt;/tbody&gt;
                &lt;table&gt;
            </code></pre>
           </figure>
       
           <p>The thead acting as "header" columns to provide some context to the provided content. The tbody
            holding the actual data cells of your table. Tables are useful for all kinds of things and can be used for: 
            expense reports, product comparisons, calendars, financial reports, shedules, statistical data and so much more. A
            truly versatile tool for any aspiring developer and useful in many kinds of situations.

        <section class="main-section" id="Header_elements:_h1_through_h6">
            <header>Header elements: h1 through h6</header>
            <article>
            <p>So you've sat down and decided kind of project you wish to create, and you start your first html
                document and you're excited! But how do you differentiate between headers and different sections? How
                do you make one header larger than another or to make one more important or noticeable than another title?
                This is where headers come in and there are 6 basic types that can be used.
            </p>
            <p>This is where headers come in. Using h1 thru h6, the sizes go from the largest (h1) to the smallest (h6)
                and allow the web developer to create headers that stand out from others. They can also be assigned classes
                like many elements, and the font size changed and modified using CSS. Header elements really bring that 
                customization to a web page that brings everything together. This allows different topics to be grouped in 
                sections on the webpage making it easier for users to scroll and process information.
            </p>

<!--FOR TOMORROW
    I managed to make a github repository for this one. It's almost going to be like a portfolio booster.
    Almost lost my file due to one of those touchpad 'I don't know what just happened' moments.
    
    Take a look at the nav-link, it's supposed to be in the <a> a class for it. It's going to take away
        the border-top property and so keep a eye on that
        
        Also remember to look and create LESSON for when i have to summarize to myself what I've learned.
        Going to go in the readme file for quick reference-->
